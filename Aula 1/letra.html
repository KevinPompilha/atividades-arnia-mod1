    <h1>Mr. Brightside</h1>
    <h2>The <i>Killers</i></h2>
    <p>
        Coming out of my cage <br>
        And I've been doing just fine <br>
        Gotta, gotta be down <br>
        Because I want it all
    </p>
    <p>
        It started out with a kiss <br>
        How did it end up like this? <br>
        It was only a kiss <br>
        It was only a kiss
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I'm falling asleep <br>
        And she's calling a cab <br>
        While he's having a smoke <br>
        And she's taking a drag <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now they're going to bed <br>
        And my stomach is sick <br>
        And it's all in my head <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But she's touching his chest now <br>
        He takes off her dress now <br>
        Let me go <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And I just can't look <br>
        It's killing me <br>
        And taking control <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Jealousy <br>
        Turning saints into the sea <br>
        Swimming through sick lullabies <br>
        Choking on your alibis <br>
        But it's just the price I pay <br>
        Destiny is calling me <br>
        Open up my eager eyes <br>
        'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside <br>
    </p>
